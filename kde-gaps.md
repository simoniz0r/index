    <h1 align="center">KDE-gaps</h1>
    <h3 align="center">A modification of <a href="https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde">Arc-Dark</a> that removes the title, window buttons, and makes the window decorations completely transparent.  KDE-gaps is setup to have a 10px gap between windows to simulate the look of a tiling Window Manager.  I suggest setting up the "Quick Tile" hotkeys in KDE's settings for easy window moving (Settings -> Shortcuts -> Global Shortcuts -> KWin).</h3>
